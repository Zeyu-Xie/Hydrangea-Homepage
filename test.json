            "title": "Take the right steps for your career by exploring the fantastic courses at this city college",
            "text": "Maybe it's because we're seeing the last of the summer weather or because the holiday season has officially ended, but September always feels like the beginning of a new year - and with it comes the opportunity to do something new. Autumn 2022 could be the perfect chance to level up your career prospects by pursuing a new qualification or by getting back into education after a long time. And there's no better place to start than BMet College. With three campuses located across the city and a wealth of opportunities for school leavers and adult learners, the college has something to suit everyone's needs. From A-Levels, to apprenticeships, B-Tec courses, HNDs or HNCs, foundation degrees and access to higher education courses that help students gain entry to university, opportunities are available at all levels for anyone aged 16 years and up. Plus, with enrolment continuing throughout Autumn 2022, there’s no need for learners to wait until January to start. BMet's three sites - James Watt College, Matthew Boulton College, and Sutton Coldfield College, are well equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and highly knowledgable tutors to give students all of the skills and confidence they need to succeed. And with great employer links across Birmingham, learners can rest assured they'll leave with the experience they need to thrive in the working world. If school leavers believe they're currently on a course that's not quite right for them, it’s not too late to come and talk to BMet and change their options. The college also offers students the chance to re-sit their English and maths qualifications while they study towards a career-orientated course. Adult learners can benefit from part-time courses and studying around work and family commitments. The college's access to higher education and university-level courses offer competitive tuition fees and smaller class sizes to give students the specialist support they need. Pat Carvalho, principal of BMet College, says: \"We have a great range of over 100 courses to choose from at the college. From subjects such as Level 1 English and maths, business and professional, health and social care, dance, music, dental, art and design, travel and tourism, media and games, construction plus many more - there's plenty to help everyone get ready for their dream career. \"All of our sites are also easily accessible by public transport. And the college can help signpost learners to the appropriate financial support and government loans they need to study with us. \"With children back in school again, we want to encourage parents in the local area to pursue their studies with us and have their time to shine. And there's also lots on offer for school leavers who didn't get the GCSEs they were quite expecting - we can help them get back on track with courses that lead to university, employment and more.\" Excellent resources All three of BMet College's campuses have their own unique character and offer an exciting student experience. Modern buildings and well-equipped classrooms help students get the most out of their studies, with spacious learning areas stocked with PCs and course materials. There are also specialist workshops and laboratories dependent on each subject area, designed to give students a glimpse of the working world. Libraries and private study areas can help give learners the space and amenities they need to prepare for exams and assessment periods too. Fantastic work experience opportunities BMet partners with local employers in Birmingham, ensuring students have the hands-on skills they need to enter the world of work after they leave college. Students who are on a vocational course will be encouraged to complete 35 hours of work experience relevant to their studies. The college's work placement coordinators will help ease students through their work placement journey. They will also be encouraged to build their confidence, communication skills and relationship with employers during their placement. Degree-level courses from great universities BMet College works in partnership with local universities to deliver degree-level courses, including with the University of Wolverhampton, Birmingham City University and the University of Worcester. Students can study courses at Level 4 and onwards, including HNCs, HNDs, foundation degrees and PGCE courses. Part-time and flexible entry options make study easier, and BMet's online learning facilities are also second-to-none. Many of the college's tuition fees are cheaper than the national average too, which are capped at £9,250 per anum. Brilliant student support As well as having a range of financial support packages aimed at taking the stress out of study, BMet's tutors are able to talk through progression opportunities with students at each stage of their development journey. Performance coaches can also help give learners further career advice, create a CV, search for job roles and prepare UCAS statements for university study. Students who require extra learning support can take advantage of the in-house mentoring service, which helps to tackle problems such as time management, self-esteem, and motivation. For those who want to discuss any concerns or worries in a safe environment without judgement, BMet's counselling service is on hand to help.

The supermodel has been the subject of romance chatters alongside Leonardo DiCaprio, 47, with speculation emerging that the duo are ‘getting to know’ one another. However, the 27-year-old appeared relaxed as she strolled through the Big Apple before she walked the runway for Tom Ford at New York Fashion Week. Gigi cut a casual fit as she headed to the high-fashion event in denim cargo style, low-rise jeans and a navy shirt that only had the top two buttons done up. She finished the look with a black leather blazer, matching handbag, chunky black boots and dark rounded sunglasses. The mother of one let her blonde hair hang loose and untamed over her shoulders, as she added minimal gold jewellery as a final accessory.

The sisters walked with Joan Smalls, as a host of famous faces watched on including Brooklyn Beckham and his wife, Nicola Peltz, as well as fellow model and supermodel Kate Moss’ daughter, Lila Grace Moss.
